# YOUR PROJECT

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

1. **config**: This folder contains scripts and files to set up the project environment. It includes a `conda` environment file and instructions to install basic libraries required for data science tasks.

2. **data**: This folder is intended to store the datasets used in your project. It's initially empty but can be populated with your specific data files.

3. **model**: This folder is dedicated to storing trained models, performance metrics, and reporting related to your models. It includes subfolders:

    - **metrics**: This folder can hold evaluation metrics or any performance measurements for your models.
    - **models**: This folder is used to store serialized model files or model checkpoints.
    - **reporting**: This folder is meant for storing any reporting or documentation related to your models or experiments.

4. **notebooks**: This folder contains Jupyter notebooks or any other exploratory analysis scripts that you might use during your data science workflow.

## Getting Started

To get started with a new data science project using this template, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

2. Set up the project environment by running the provided `config/install.sh` script. This will create a conda environment with the necessary libraries.

```bash
cd config
./install.sh
```

3. Add your data files to the `data` folder. You can organize the data into subfolders based on your project requirements. The `data` folder content is by default ignored (in .gitignore file)

4. Use the notebooks in the `notebooks` folder to explore the data, perform analysis, and develop models.

5. Save trained models in the `model/models` folder. Store performance metrics in the `model/metrics` folder. Document any reports or experiment findings in the `model/reporting` folder.
